   project.

   GitHub repository [according to the instructions]
   (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories

## Deploy

The production version of the project will automatically be linted, built, and
deployed to GitHub Pages, in the `gh-pages` branch, every time the `main` branch
is updated. For example, after a direct push or an accepted pull request. To do
this, you need to edit the `homepage` field in the `package.json` file,
replacing `your_username` and `your_repo_name` with your own, and submit the
changes to GitHub.
